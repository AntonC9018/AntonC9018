## Hello there, welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Anton Curmanschii, I'm an intelligent and competent programmer, CS undergraduate.
I have programmed almost every day for the past 3 years in my free time, as well as at university.
I like developing games, tools and libraries, and contributing to open-source projects when I feel like it will benefit me or the community.

Lately, I've been making a game in Unity, while developing a GPRC game server for it on ASP.NET Core, and maintaining a custom CLI tool for managing the complexity of the project.

## Projects

I'm currently working on a Unity board game, with an ASP.NET Core GRPC game server and an ASP.NET Core web application for player statistics.
I'm doing this game mostly for learning purposes, but also to try out and accumulate some useful tools and libraries to use in later projects, it's not about getting revenue.

I've worked on improving the **JCLI library** for the D programming language, conceived and developed by its author [BradleyChatha](https://github.com/BradleyChatha).
Its main goal is to allow the consumers to easily develop command-line applications in D.
It allows parsing command-line arguments, automatically converting to the corresponding user types, automatically generating the help message from the user-defined attributes, and much more!
It makes extensive use of compile-time introspection features of D to achieve a declarative and easy-to-use API, with a modular design.

I'm also developing a C# plugin-based Roslyn code generator, **Kari**.
It can seemlessly integrate with any C# project of any version, including Unity projects, and would generate code, obtained by analyzing the input source files, using the Roslyn API's.
This allows creating awesome declarative API's and eliminates a lot of boilerplate.
I has been initially developed for a game that I with my colleague had worked on.

The project where it's been initially used:

At last, I'd like to share my **code-based tool for studying shaders**, developed in D.
The goal is to be able to quickly experiment with shaders, with hotreload of shader code and with automatically generated sliders and input boxes for the uniforms, through a lightweight declarative API.

There are many more projects, including visualizations, game and web dev, and just random experiments, as well as most of the university assignments, where I had to make graphical visualizations, implement various algorithms and data structures, implement GUI's, configure databases and write queries, or just explain various computer science topics.
