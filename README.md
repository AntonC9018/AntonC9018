## Hello there, welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Anton Curmanschii, I'm an intelligent and competent programmer, CS undergraduate, doing my 1st year master.
I have programmed almost every day for the past 5 years, either in my free time, or at university.
I like developing games, tools and libraries, and contributing to open-source projects when I feel like it will benefit me or the community.

Recently, I've been studying ASP.NET Core, EF Core and other miscellanious frameworks and libraries by making an [e-commerce / postings app](https://github.com/AntonC9018/49).

## Projects

The most recent project is an app where you can make postings (like selling or renting stuff online, or just ad postings).
If you're from Moldova, you have likely used 999.md, which is the inspiration.
It features an ASP.NET Core backend, dynamically created pages implemented with Razor, with Typescipt frontend scripts hosted by Vite.
It integrates a few popular libraries/frameworks like Tailwind, Automapper, Swagger, EF Core.
I'm also using Nuke for the build tasks and scripts.

I've worked on a Unity board game, for which I wanted to do a backend and a web statistics app, but that got scrapped for now.
I've been doing this game mostly for learning purposes, but also to try out and accumulate some useful tools and libraries to use in later projects, it's not about getting revenue.
It turned out, RPC situation in Unity is kind of awful.

I've worked on improving the **JCLI library** for the D programming language, conceived and developed by its author [BradleyChatha](https://github.com/BradleyChatha).
Its main goal is to allow the consumers to easily develop command-line applications in D.
It allows parsing command-line arguments, automatically converting to the corresponding user types, automatically generating the help message from the user-defined attributes, and much more!
It makes extensive use of compile-time introspection features of D to achieve a declarative and easy-to-use API, with a modular design.

I'm also developing a C# plugin-based Roslyn code generator, **Kari**.
It can seemlessly integrate with any C# project of any version, including Unity projects, and would generate code, obtained by analyzing the input source files, using the Roslyn API's.
This allows creating awesome declarative API's and eliminates a lot of boilerplate.
I has been initially developed for a game that I with my colleague had worked on.

The project where it's been initially used:

At last, I'd like to share my **code-based tool for studying shaders**, developed in D.
The goal is to be able to quickly experiment with shaders, with hotreload of shader code and with automatically generated sliders and input boxes for the uniforms, through a lightweight declarative API.

There are many more projects, including [visualizations](https://github.com/AntonC9018/Odwiv), [game](https://github.com/AntonC9018/race) and [web dev](https://github.com/AntonC9018/future-rps), and just [random experiments](https://github.com/AntonC9018/CommandDotNetNuke), as well as most of the university assignments (most of the repo names start with `uni_`), where I had to make [graphical visualizations](https://github.com/AntonC9018/uni_graphics), implement various [algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/AntonC9018/uni_asdc), implement [GUI's](https://github.com/AntonC9018/uni_gui), [configure databases and write queries](https://github.com/AntonC9018/uni_sql), or just explain various computer science topics.
